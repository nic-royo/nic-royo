Hi, I’m @nic-royo, I'm a Spanish/Colombian currently studying a bachelor of Computer Science at the University of London, with one of their distance learning programs.
I’m interested in data science, full stack development, and computer architecture.  
I’m currently learning mainly Node.js, SQL, python, but would like to learn more about React, .NET and R once I have free time.
